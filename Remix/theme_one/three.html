	<h3>The Goose with the Golden Eggs</h3>
	<p> <span>
		One day a countryman going </span> <span>to the nest of his </span> <span>Goose found there an egg </span><span>all yellow and all glittering.
		</span>	
		<br>
		<br>
		<span>
		When he took it up </span> <span>it was as heavy as </span> <span>lead and he was going </span><span>to throw it away, because </span><span>he thought a trick had </span> <span>been played upon him.
		<br>
		<br>
	
		But </span><span>he took it home on </span><span>second thought and soon found </span> <span> his delight that it was </span> <span>an egg of pure gold.</span>
	
		<br>
		<br>
		<span>
		Every morning the same thing </span><span>, and he soon became rich </span><span>by selling his eggs.	
	
		<br>
		<br>
		
		As </span><span>he grew rich he grew </span><span>greedy; and thinking to get </span> <span>at once all the gold </span> <span>the Goose could give, he </span><span>killed it and opened it </span><span>only to find nothing.</span>
