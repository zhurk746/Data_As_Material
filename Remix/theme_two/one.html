	<h3>The Goose with the Golden Eggs</h3> <br><br>
	<p>
		
		One <span>day </span>a <span>countryman</span> going to the <span>nest</span> of his <span>Goose</span> found there an <span>egg</span> all yellow and all glittering.

	<br>
	
		When he took it up it was as heavy as <span>lead</span>and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a <span>trick</span> had been played upon him.

	
	<br>
	
	
		But he took it home on second <span>thought</span> and soon found to his <span>delight</span> that it was an <span>egg</span> of pure <span>gold.</span>

	<br>
	
	
		Every <span>morning</span> the same <span>thing</span> occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his <span>eggs.	</span>
	
	<br>
	
	
		As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the <span>gold</span> the <span>Goose</span> could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.
