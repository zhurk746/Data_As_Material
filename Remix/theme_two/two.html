	<h3>The <mark style="background-color: #929685;">Goose</mark> with the <mark style="background-color: #89805E;">Golden</mark> <mark style="background-color: #CDB49E;"> eggs</mark></h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		One day a countryman going to the nest of his <mark style="background-color: #929685;">Goose</mark> found there an <mark style="background-color: #E4CBB6;">egg</mark> all yellow and all <mark style="background-color: #7C6A49;">glittering.</mark>
		When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him.
		But he took it home on second thought and soon found to his delight that it was an <mark style="background-color: #E4CBB6;">egg</mark> of pure <mark style="background-color: #A98545;">gold.</mark>
		Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his <mark style="background-color: #CDB49E;"> eggs.</mark>	
		As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the <mark style="background-color: #A98545;">gold</mark> the <mark style="background-color: #929685;">Goose</mark> could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.
