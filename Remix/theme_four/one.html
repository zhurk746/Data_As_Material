	<h3>The <span style="font-size: 40pt;">Goose</span> with the <span style="font-size: 40pt;">Golden</span> Eggs</h3>
	<p> 
		One day a countryman going to the nest of his <span style="font-size: 40pt;">Goose </span> <span style="font-size: 40pt;">found</span> there an egg all yellow and all glittering.
		<br>
		<br>
		When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him.
		<br>
		<br>
		But he took it home on second thought and soon <span style="font-size: 40pt;">found</span> to his delight that it was an egg of pure <span style="font-size: 40pt;">gold.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became <span style="font-size: 40pt;">rich</span> by selling his eggs.	
		<br>
		<br>
		As he grew <span style="font-size: 40pt;">rich</span> he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the <span style="font-size: 40pt;">gold</span> the <span style="font-size: 40pt;">Goose</span> could give, he killed it and opened it only to <span style="font-size: 40pt;">find</span> nothing.
