It was an Egg of the Phoenix; and when the spring of the year drew near the Phoenix bird came out of his nest, and began to preen himself upon the Egg, until at last he got it clean and white as glass. But when he was ready to set it down upon the ground, he found to his sorrow that he had forgotten how to fly, and could not bring himself to leave the egg on the ground, and break it";
