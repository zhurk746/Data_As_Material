		<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Goose with the Golden Eggs <br></span>
		<br>
		One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and all glittering.
		<br>
		<br>
		When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him.
		<br>
		<br>
		But he took it home on second thought and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold.
		<br>
		<br>
		Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs.	
		<br>
		<br>
		As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.
