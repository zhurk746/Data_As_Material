	<h3>The Goose with the <span style="word-spacing: 50px;">Golden Eggs</span></h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and <span>all glittering.</span>
	<br>
	<br>
	
		When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, 
	<br>
	<br>	
		because he thought a trick had been played <span>upon him.</span>
	<br>
	<br>
	
		But he took it home on second thought and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of <span>pure gold.</span>

	
	<br>
	<br>
	
		Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling <span>his eggs.</span>	
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
		As he grew rich he <span>grew greedy;</span> 
	<br>
	<br>	
		and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, 
		<br>
		<br>
		he killed it and opened it only to 
		<br>
		<br>
		<span>find nothing.</span>
