					<span style="font-weight: 700;">The Goose with the Golden Eggs </span><br>
					One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and all glittering.
					When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him.
					But he took it home on second thought and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold.
					Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs.	
					As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.
