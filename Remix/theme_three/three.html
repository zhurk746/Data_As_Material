        <span>The Goose with the Golden Eggs</span>
        <span>One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose </span> 
        <span>found there an egg all yellow and all glittering.</span> 
        <span>When he took it up it was as heavy as lead </span> 
        <span>and he was going to throw it away, because </span> 
        <span>he thought a trick had been played upon him.</span> 
        <span>But he took it home on second thought </span> 
        <span>and soon found to his delight that </span> 
        <span>it was an egg of pure gold.</span> 
        <span>Every morning the same thing occurred, </span> 
        <span>and he soon became rich by selling his eggs.</span> 
        <span>As he grew rich he grew greedy; </span> 
		<span>and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give,</span> 
		<span>he killed it and opened it</span>
        <span>only to find nothing.</span>
